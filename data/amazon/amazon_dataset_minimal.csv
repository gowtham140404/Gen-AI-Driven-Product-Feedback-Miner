Case,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Customizable-Breathable-Sickleflow/dp/B09TL7Z2DZ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,Anonymous User,"I'm NOT a fan-boy or a paid shill. I'm just a guy that likes to build computers. I was searching for an extremely large case for a water cooling build with a full size E-ATX server motherboard (SSI-EEB) I had already purchased 2 large format cases and returned them both due to poor engineering and design. (TT Tower 500 and a Cougar) After 2 failures in a row, I bought this CoolerMaster 700 HAF with a good bit of anxiety. I'm absolutely amazed."
Case,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Customizable-Breathable-Sickleflow/dp/B09TL7Z2DZ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,Rhamnetin,"I chose this case based on Linus' and TechPowerUp's reviews because I dislike the process of building PCs and just want a case that makes it as easy as possible, considering my E-ATX motherboard and tendency to use 360mm AIOs (and possibly AIO cooled GPUs in the future). My case before this was the Lian-Li PC-O11D XL, and this absolutely dwarfs it."
Case,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Customizable-Breathable-Sickleflow/dp/B09TL7Z2DZ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,go0den0w,"When I purchased this case, I had never built a PC before. I'd also recently ended my 5-year career as an electrician to go to law school. I needed a hobby & a way to satisfy my need to build stuff. Well, I have gone to town on this case and loved it. Most of the black screws it came with are half silver from me taking it apart so many times. The case is big enough to be a sort of 'blank canvas' for just about any configuration you can imagine, albeit with some limitations: I think it's a bit small for a 16mm OD PETG custom loop; I wish it had been designed to support bottom intake fans; and the top clearance for a 360mm AIO/radiator is too small for a push/pull configuration. Keep in mind if you continue to read, I am running an overclocked i9-10900K & need as much cooling capability as possible (with all case parts still properly attached, of course)"
Case,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Customizable-Breathable-Sickleflow/dp/B09TL7Z2DZ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,Amazon Customer,"This case is quite a rabbit hole to be sure, I'll begin with the awful QC for the case RGB. A great deal of time, and in my case, a front fan will have broken RGB which diminishes the perceived value of the case massively (As otherwise it is a very outdated design using tooling from 5+ years ago.)"
Case,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Customizable-Breathable-Sickleflow/dp/B09TL7Z2DZ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,Donny,"Got my case after waiting almost a week and got it all put together. First the good. The case seems to be well built and much sturdier than my old Corsair 100r. This case does help keep things cool. A 31 degree difference on my rig. Cable management is not bad. Compared to a 100R, its superbly fantastic! Plenty of room to build in. Now the bad. Less than 24 hours after getting everything put together, the rgb on the front fans quit. Well 1 blue light on the top fan works but wont change in any way. The fans do still run but 1 had a wobble in it from the get go. Contacted Cooler Master and they say that I'm trying to run too many fans. I'm running the 2 front fans the case came with as well as the rear exhaust fan the case came with. Too many, I think not! They say they are sorry for any problems that I may be experiencing with their product. No offer to send me two more fans, which I sent pictures showing the issue, the don't seems to care and have stopped responding to me. With that kind of customer service they should be run out of business. A shame really. I like the case, but will be sending it back and looking into another manufacturer who has a better customer service. Secondly, for reasons I can explain I have had 3 blue screens and 2 random restarts after using this case. I've checked for something shorting out, standoff in the wrong place, anything that could be causing this. Nothing. Even reseated the ram and cpu. No improvement. Put everything back in my 100R and it works flawlessly. Runs hotter but works perfect. Don't know if something in the front ports are wacky or what. I think the thing is cursed. Bye Bye Cooler Master and Thanks for nothing!!!"

Other than that, I really like this keyboard.The ability to use it wired, wirelessly with dongle, or with Bluetooth is fantastic."

Why you may ask? 1. It came with PBT caps already, compared to the originals. 
2. It came with a coiled connector. 
 3. The color was pretty convincing. 
 I was hesitant with what the negative reviews stated. Since the 30th ann. version was a bit of an upgrade, I caved."

 Cool software 
 Nice keys

Having wired, USB, and Bluetooth as options for connecting devices is stellar, and the dial on the keyboard gave the keyboard a unique feel. The tactile keys weren't amazing, but I think I could have gotten used to them. The lighting under the keycaps was appealing to add to the pros."
Mouse,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Adjustable-Ultraweave-MasterPlus/dp/B0BGYB8DBC?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,Bryce D.,"I felt like writing this review just because I felt it deserved some recognition for how great it really is. I was a big fan of the MM711 when it first came out. The shape was unique and the weight was extremely impressive. I stopped using it mostly because of the switches being inconsistent and the build quality was not the greatest. I had always been hoping they would make a version of this shape, but with a better build quality and better switches. They honestly exceeded my expectations with this new MM712."
Mouse,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Adjustable-Ultraweave-MasterPlus/dp/B0BGYB8DBC?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,Dusty,"I dont know how this mouse is not talked about more. It is extremely light to the point that I forget it is even in my hand when playing most video games. It charges and holds a charge very well. The RGB is actually really nice and the battery indicator feature is very convenient (as an RBG hater). Coming from a logitech mouse, the Optical Switches are phenomenal and do not double click even after extended use. The software for the mouse is amazing as well, providing you with literally endless RGB and switch adjusting options. This mouse beats our every mouse I was looking at for a fraction of the price."
Mouse,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Adjustable-Ultraweave-MasterPlus/dp/B0BGYB8DBC?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,thunder2132,"I've gone on a bit of a mouse spree lately, picking up about 5 mice to try out. This mouse was recommended as great for its price, and I would tend to agree with that. It's a bit smaller than mice that I've used, but is nice and lightweight, and feels good in my hand. I use a hybrid claw/palm grip, and have fairly large hands. I was able to comfortably use this mouse. The software for it is pretty decent, and I was able to configure it to my likings without any issues. The software did require that a firmware update be pushed before I could use it, which I appreciate as I always want to be on the latest firmware for my peripherals."
Mouse,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Adjustable-Ultraweave-MasterPlus/dp/B0BGYB8DBC?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,max,"I recently purchased a mouse that has left me quite disappointed for multiple reasons. First and foremost, its battery life is significantly lacking, lasting only 2 to 4 hours during active gaming sessions. Additionally, the sensor placement, which is positioned above the center of the mouse, deviates from the norm and often proves more hindering than helpful."
Mouse,https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-Adjustable-Ultraweave-MasterPlus/dp/B0BGYB8DBC?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1,Camden s.,My $7 mouse from wish lasted longer than this mouse. If you rage a lot don't buy this mouse because it'll shatter after 1 baby slam. Other than that it's a decent mouse
